Stream Grapher
=============

It's a tool to visualize data streams or signals in real time. It can draw the 
streams in different ways from oscilloscope views to frequency domain graphs.

It's intended use is in development and prototyping of hardware or software
that generates some kind of signal to visualize in 2D. It's also useful to
test software filters.

The most important parts of Stream Grapher are backends and widgets.
A backend generates samples or get the samples from external hardware and pass
them to the widgets. The widgets only graph the samples.

Backends
--------
* File Reader (filereader.py): Read samples from a comma separated text file.
* Math functions (maths.py): Generates math functions.
* JACK audio (pyjack.py): Provides a JACK client.
* Sthocastic processes (sthocastic.py): Generates sthocastic streams.
* Spiro COM (spiro_com.py: Read samples from Serial COM port.

Widgets
-------
* StreamWidget: It's an oscilloscope for only one stream.
* MultipleStreamWidget: It's an oscilloscope that draws multiple streams.
* MultipleStreamWidget: It's an oscilloscope that draws multiple streams.
* BrowsableStreamWidget: It's a widget that let you move in the x axis along all the
signal.
* FFTWidget: Draws the FFT of the input stream.

USAGE
=====

To use stream_grapher you must a configuration and save it to config.py (see 
config_example.py) in the same direcory of stream_grapher.py.

Audio
-----
Stream grapher provides a JACK backend to get the audio samples, so you must have
jack and pyjack installed in order to use it. Take a look to config_jack.py to
write your custom config.py.

JACK: http://jackaudio.org/
PyJack: http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-jack/



Custom backend (graph your own hardware or software streams)
--------------
To use stream_grapher with your hardware or software you must write a backend 
that gets the samples and pass them to the graphs. It should be very easy in 
most cases and there are a lot of examples in backends directory.
Take a look to spiro_com that receives samples from the serial port.
