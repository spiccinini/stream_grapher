Stream Grapher
==============

It's a tool to visualize data streams or signals in real time. It can draw the 
streams in different ways from oscilloscope views to frequency domain graphs.

It's intended use is in development and prototyping of hardware or software
that generates some kind of signal to visualize in 2D. It's also useful to
test software filters.

The most important components of Stream Grapher are backends_ and widgets_.
A backend generates samples or get the samples from external hardware and pass
them to the widgets. The widgets only graph the samples.

If you want to use it with some hardware you have thats plugged in some way
to the PC, like serial COM port, USB, Parallel, etc, you must write your own
`custom backend`_.

Backends
--------
* File Reader (filereader.py): Read samples from a comma separated text file.
* Math functions (maths.py): Generates math functions.
* JACK audio (pyjack.py): Provides a JACK client.
* Sthocastic processes (sthocastic.py): Generates sthocastic streams.
* Spiro COM (spiro_com.py: Read samples from Serial COM port.

Widgets
-------
* StreamWidget: It's an oscilloscope for only one stream.
* MultipleStreamWidget: It's an oscilloscope that draws multiple streams.
* MultipleStreamWidget: It's an oscilloscope that draws multiple streams.
* BrowsableStreamWidget: It's a widget that let you move in the x axis along
  all the signal.
* FFTWidget: Draws the FFT of the input stream.

Dependencies
============

* python >=2.5 (2.5 should work but it's tested under 2.6)
* pyglet 1.1
* numpy
* scipy
* PyJack (optional, see Audio_)

Install
=======

You don't need to install stream_grapher, just download the code to a directory
and use it from there (see Usage below). The idea behind is that you have
all the code right there to see and modify.

You must have Dependencies_ installed.

Usage
=====

To use stream_grapher you must a configuration and save it to config.py (see 
config_example.py) in the same direcory of stream_grapher.py.

Audio
-----

Stream grapher provides a JACK backend to get the audio samples, so you must have
jack and pyjack installed in order to use it. Take a look to config_jack.py to
write your custom config.py.

JACK: http://jackaudio.org/
PyJack: http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-jack/



Custom backend
--------------

To use stream_grapher with your hardware or software you must write a backend 
that gets the samples and pass them to the graphs. It should be very easy in 
most cases and there are a lot of examples in backends directory.
Take a look to spiro_com that receives samples from the serial port.
